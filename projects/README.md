Pick 5 cards implemented in dominion.c (from assignment 1). Refactor the code so that these cards are implmemented in their own functions, rather than as part of the switch statement in cardEffect. Then, call the functions for these cards int he appropriate place in cardEffect.

Introduce some bugs in 4 out of the 5 cards. Implementing bugs in Smithy and Adventurer is mandatory.

All code should compile and run.
